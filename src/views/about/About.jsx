        <p className="mt-2">
          Hi! üëãüèª My name is Agustin, I'm an enthusiastic developer.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          I am a person who seeks professional and personal growth, focused on
          teamwork.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Being a creative person I have focused mainly on the frontend area.
          From this position, I can contribute to design, user experience, and
          functionality to provide solutions. I like to say I'm a frontend
          developer with knowledge in the backend.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          I discovered my passion for programming 2 years ago, and since then
          I started to study on my own. I began with some courses about HTML and
          CSS and then I learned about other technologies and started to build
          some projects. Later, I decided to keep learning and I joined a coding
          bootcamp at Soy Henry, where I learned technical skills. I also want
          to emphasize the soft skills I developed during the bootcamp, such as
          teamwork and effective communication.
