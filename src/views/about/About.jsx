    <p>Hello! 👋🏻 I am Agustin, I'm a entusiast developer.</p>
    <p>
      I am a person who seeks professional and personal growth, focused on
      teamwork.
    </p><br></br>
    <p>
      Being a creative person I have focused mainly on the frontend area,
      and I believe the solutions can be solved efficiently where design,
      user experience and functionality are important parts in the
      development of any web application. But i like to say im a frontend
      developer with knowledge in backend too.
    </p><br></br>
    <p>
      I discover my passion for programmin 2 years ago, and since this date
      I started to study by myself. Then I started with some courses about
      html and css and at this point I really discover that I can bring
      solution for people.
